- It contains an index called the WBL index which measures the extent of legal equality women have with men in various dimensions of their lives (including marriage, mobility, work, pay etc.)
- Main indicators: Mobility, Workplace, Pay, Marriage, Parenthood, Entrepreneurship, Assets, and Pension

A visualisation of the analysis can be found [here](https://emckclac-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/k20047713_kcl_ac_uk/EazFMWgpBLdOjOMEt-Hu8vMBtI77dR8OJCfZAJt8fcROIA?e=1NuOFb).
